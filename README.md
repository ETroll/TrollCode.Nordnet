# TrollCode.Nordnet

A C# library for Nordnet API and its feeds. Nordnet is a large online investment broker that is very popular in Scandinavia. 

It is currently being developed live on Twitch every sunday morning.

More info will come.

So far the library can connect to the public and private feed and around a quarter of the API methods are implemented.
